Hey there! I'm Amir

My coding story starts like everyone else with a single "Hello World". From that moment forward I truly could not see myself doing anything but coding. As a child I was a very strong chess player, when kids used to play with toys I was studying chess. The mindset chess gave me from the young age made me very competitve and intrested in puzzle like activities, from boardgames to escape rooms and more. Even within movies my prefrence are always those that make you really think and I am always trying to solve the mystery before it has even started. The puzzle like feeling coding brings is something no other industry or job contains, its fun yet challenging aspects has only made me fall more and more in love with it.
As my expertise in coding grew my undrestanding on how just a few lines of code could really make a difference came to prespective. I have been fortunate enought to see these differences in different companies I interned at:  -Reformatting and bringing change to Connexall's reports, influencing a shift  from ssrs reports to the power BI platform. 
    -Dockerizing customer application packages for ease installation and use 
    -Automating IT onboarding processes 
These experiences made me feel like I could trully make a difference and has only motivated me to do more and have a bigger impact within the industry. During my last year of school, I put an enphasis in ML/AI related work and I found this field especially intresting. There is something about the power of making a machine learning algorithm with just a few lines of code that can with enough data perform tasks even better than humans can.

All in all I have always liked challenging puzzels and want to improve everyday to work towards facing more difficult puzzels in the future.
