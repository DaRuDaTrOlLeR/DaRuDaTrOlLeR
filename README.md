# Hey there! I'm Amir :raising_hand_man:

### Who I Am
Like most people, my coding story started with a single "Hello World" in high school, but there was something about executing my first successful program that felt like I had been doing this my whole life. Growing up as a competitive chess player, I havea always had a intrest in puizzles and strategy games. I spent countless hours  working through complex puzzles and coming up with strategic solutions to optimize my outcome. As I progressed in my coding journey, I realized that this mindset that has existed within me for years would shape my approach to solving complex technical problems.

### What I've Done
As my expertise in coding grew my undrestanding on how just a few lines of code could really make a difference came to prespective. Like solving any other puzzel coding is really all about figure out the cleanest, simplest, and most efficient solution to the project at hand. I have been fortunate to grow my skillset through several past experiences:

-Reformatting and bringing change to customer reports, influencing a shift from ssrs reports to the power BI platform company wide
-Dockerizing customer application packages for ease installation and use
-Automating IT onboarding processes

### What I'm looking for
I am always looking for projects and oppurtunities to hone my skills whether that is in all sorts of projects or in chess. Please feel free to reach out to me on [Linkedln](https://www.linkedin.com/in/amirrezamoghtader) or shoot me an [Email](mailto:amirreza.moghtader@yahoo.ca)! :grin:
