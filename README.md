# :raising_hand_man: Hey there! I'm Amir
### Who I Am
Like most people, my coding story started with a single "Hello World" in high school, but there was something about executing my first successful program that felt like I had been doing this my whole life. Growing up as a competitive chess player, I've always loved puzzles and games of strategy. I spent countless hours  working through complex puzzles and coming up with strategic solutions to optimize my outcome. As I progressed in my coding journey, I realized that this mindset that has existed within me for years would shape my approach to solving complex technical problems.

### What I've Done
The more I coded, the more I appreciated how just a few lines of code could really make a difference; Like solving any other puzzel, coding is really about finding the cleanest, simplest, and most efficient solution to the project at hand. I have been fortunate to grow my skillset through several past work experiences:
- Reformatting and bringing change to customer reports, influencing a company-wide shift from ssrs reports to the PowerBI at [Connexall](https://www.connexall.com/)
- Dockerizing customer application packages for easy installation and use at [Ericsson](https://www.ericsson.com/en)
- Automating IT onboarding processes at [Ericsson](https://www.ericsson.com/en)

### What I'm looking for
I am #OpenToWork and am always looking for projects, especially at the intersection of chess and AI/ML, to hone my skills. Please feel free to reach out to me on [Linkedln](https://www.linkedin.com/in/amirrezamoghtader) or shoot me an [Email](mailto:amirreza.moghtader@yahoo.ca)! :grin:
